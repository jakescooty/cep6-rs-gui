//! Recovering the engine's own unit choices from its output.
//!
//! The synthesis filter is `y[n] = e[n] + sum_k a[k]*y[n-1-k]`, so inverse
//! filtering the SDK's audio with a candidate frame's coefficients recovers what
//! the excitation must have been if that frame were the one used. The residual is
//! stored at half rate and expanded by zero-order hold, which means the true
//! excitation satisfies `e[2m] == e[2m+1]` within a pitch period. Scoring that
//! identity separates the right frame from every other one: the correct frame
//! scores 0.3 to 1.2 against 64 to 174 for the wrong phase, out of 791,464
//! candidates.
//!
//! This is ground truth. It gives the exact frame and unit sequence behind any
//! Swift WAV without knowing anything about unit selection, so it is what the
//! selection stage gets validated against.
//!
//! `concat_units` walks frames consecutively inside a unit, so a four-candidate
//! local probe almost always suffices and the exhaustive search only runs at unit
//! boundaries. That search is the whole cost, and it is pure data parallelism over
//! independent frames -- which is why this lives in Rust rather than in the Python
//! original, where it was minutes per second of audio.
