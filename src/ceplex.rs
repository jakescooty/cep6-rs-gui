//! Cepstral's own pronunciation front end, lifted from `ceplex_us.dll`.
//!
//! This replaces the festival-derived lexicon and letter-to-sound model. Against
//! a 4000-word sample those agreed with Cepstral on only 42.9% of words, because
//! the two systems are simply not the same: Cepstral's dictionary is 13,387
//! entries and its LTS answers everything else.
//!
//! The split is deliberate and self-explaining. The LTS predicts `colonel` as
//! `k aa1 er1 n ah0 l`, which is wrong, and `colonel` is one of the 13,387
//! dictionary entries at `k er1 n ah0 l`. The dictionary holds precisely what the
//! LTS gets wrong, which is why `the`, `of`, `one` and `said` are absent from it
//! while `colonel` and `sword` are present.
//!
//! `_out/pack_ceplex.py` decodes both out of the DLL at fixed RVAs. Decoding
//! happens there, so nothing here needs the huffman tables.
//!
//! Phones arrive with stress attached (`eh1`, `ah0`), and there is no syllable
//! structure in this lexicon, so `Phone::syl_end` is left unset and the naming
//! rules fall back to maximal onset.
